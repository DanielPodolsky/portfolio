# Projects

## What projects have you built?
### Also: Your work, portfolio, what have you made, show me your projects, examples of your work

I've built several full-stack applications that demonstrate my skills in React, Node.js, AWS, and AI integration. My main projects are MentorHIT (an AI mentoring platform that won national recognition), an LLM-Powered Log Analyzer, this developer portfolio with an AI chatbot, and contributions to Exify. Each project taught me something different about building production-grade software.

## Tell me about MentorHIT
### Also: MentorHIT, mentor hit, mentoring project, AWS hackathon, hackathon project, first place

MentorHIT is an AI-powered academic mentoring platform that I built during a hackathon at my college. We identified a real problem - most students lack access to personalized career guidance and mentorship. I took on full-stack development responsibilities in our team of four.

I built core parts of both the React frontend and the backend API, and integrated AWS services into our architecture. The platform uses AWS Bedrock LLMs with RAG implementation using OpenSearch, so students can chat with an AI mentor and get personalized guidance based on their personality, grades, and real-time job market data.

We won first place at the HIT hackathon and second place nationally at the AWS Public Sector Innovation Hackathon. The college is now reviewing our proposal to integrate MentorHIT into their official system. This project taught me that language models do incredible things when you architect the system correctly.

## Tell me about the Log Analyzer
### Also: LLM Log Analyzer, log analyzer, logging project, anomaly detection, DevOps project

My LLM-Powered Log Analyzer is an intelligent system that automates anomaly detection and root-cause classification. The problem I solved: manual log analysis is time-consuming and error-prone, delaying incident response for critical issues like database failures, network outages, and security breaches.

I built a containerized microservices platform with a React frontend, Node.js analyzer service, and Python LLM service. One thing I'm proud of is the factory pattern I implemented for LLM provider abstraction - it lets you swap between Hugging Face and OpenAI without changing application code. I also built a statistical analysis engine and automated email alerting with rate limiting.

The system automatically detects and classifies critical infrastructure issues into root cause categories with actionable AI-powered recommendations. It's a great example of how AI can augment DevOps workflows.

## Tell me about your portfolio website
### Also: Portfolio, this website, your site, developer portfolio, personal site

This portfolio is built with React 19, TypeScript in strict mode, Tailwind CSS v4, and shadcn/ui components. It achieves Lighthouse 100 scores through performance optimization techniques like code splitting with React.lazy and image optimization.

The most interesting feature is this AI chatbot you're talking to right now. It uses RAG with GPT and Pinecone vector search to answer questions about me accurately. I also implemented GSAP scroll animations, dark/light theme switching, and responsive design throughout. Building this portfolio deepened my understanding of modern React patterns, component-driven architecture, and production-grade frontend practices.

## What is Exify?
### Also: Exify, open source, contributions, code contributor

I'm a code contributor to Exify, an application with over 1000 active users. Contributing to an existing codebase taught me a lot about reading other people's code, following established patterns, and making meaningful contributions to a project used by real people.

## What's your most challenging project?
### Also: Difficult project, challenging work, proud of, best project, hardest thing you built

MentorHIT was my most challenging and rewarding project. During the hackathon, we had limited time to build something that actually worked. I had to quickly learn AWS services I hadn't used before - Bedrock for LLMs, OpenSearch for vector search - and integrate them into a cohesive system.

The pressure of competition taught me to make architectural decisions quickly and trust my instincts. When we won first place at HIT and then second place nationally at the AWS hackathon, it validated that good architecture and teamwork can produce impressive results even under time pressure.
