# Projects

## MentorHIT
**Status:** 2nd Place · AWS Public Sector Innovation Hackathon (National)
**Type:** Full-stack Application
**Tech Stack:** React/Vite, AWS, RAG, LLMs, Serverless

### What it does
AI-powered academic mentoring platform that provides personalized guidance to students using RAG-enhanced LLMs and institutional knowledge bases.

### Problem
Students lack access to personalized academic guidance and mentorship at scale, while educational institutions struggle to provide individualized support to growing student populations.

### Solution
Built an intelligent mentoring platform leveraging AWS Bedrock LLMs with RAG implementation using OpenSearch for context-aware responses. Designed serverless architecture with AWS Lambda, enabling students to receive personalized academic guidance based on institutional knowledge and have real-time job market insights.

### Impact
Recognized with 2nd place at AWS Public Sector Innovation Hackathon for innovative application of AI in education, demonstrating practical solution for scaling academic support services.

### What I learned
Building its LLM query flow taught me that language models do incredible things when you architect the system correctly.

## LLM-Powered Log Analyzer
**Status:** Personal Project
**Type:** Full-stack Application
**Tech Stack:** React/Vite, Python, Docker, LLMs

### What it does
Intelligent system that automates anomaly detection and root-cause classification using LLMs.

### Problem
Manual log analysis is time-consuming and error-prone, delaying incident response for critical issues like database failures, network outages, and security breaches.

### Solution
Architected and built a containerized microservices platform with React frontend, Node.js analyzer service, and Python LLM service. Implemented factory pattern for LLM provider abstraction (Hugging Face, OpenAI), statistical analysis engine, and automated email alerting with rate limiting. Engineered error handling with graceful degradation and timeout protection.

### Impact
Automates detection and classification of critical infrastructure issues into root cause categories with actionable AI-powered recommendations, enabling faster incident response.

### What I learned
Same lesson as MentorHIT: language models do incredible things when you architect the system correctly.
