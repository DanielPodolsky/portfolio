# Technical Skills

## What is your tech stack?

### Also: What technologies do you use, tech stack, what do you know, your skills, what can you build with

MERN stack - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js - plus AWS and AI/LLM integration. Full-stack from database to UI, with a focus on AI capabilities.

## Do you know React? What about frontend development?

### Also: React experience, frontend experience, UI development, client-side, do you use React, JavaScript frameworks, React skills

React 19 is my primary framework - hooks, functional components, Context API. TypeScript strict mode always. Tailwind v4 with shadcn/ui for styling, Vite for builds. My portfolio hits Lighthouse 100 through lazy loading and memoization.

---

## What backend technologies do you use?

### Also: Backend, server-side, Node, Express, API, do you know Node.js

Node.js and Express for backends. REST APIs with proper middleware and error handling. MongoDB with Mongoose for data. Also do serverless - deployed Lambda functions on AWS for scalable services.

---

## Do you have cloud experience? AWS?

### Also: Cloud, AWS, Amazon, serverless, Lambda, deployment, infrastructure

Hands-on AWS from MentorHIT (won second at AWS hackathon). Worked with Lambda, Bedrock for LLMs, and OpenSearch for vector search. Understand serverless patterns and how to design systems that scale.

## Do you work with AI? What's your experience with LLMs?

### Also: AI experience, LLM experience, machine learning, GPT, RAG, artificial intelligence, generative AI, do you know AI, what AI have you built, AI projects

AI integration is my specialty - specifically RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). Built three AI apps: MentorHIT (Bedrock + RAG), LLM Log Analyzer (factory pattern for provider abstraction), and this chatbot (Claude + Pinecone). Key insight: language models shine when the architecture is right.

---

## What tools and DevOps do you use?

### Also: DevOps, Docker, Git, deployment, version control, containers

Docker for containerization, Git with conventional commits. Deploy on Vercel for frontend, AWS for full-stack. Clean git history matters - it shows professionalism.

---

## What are you currently learning?

### Also: Learning, exploring, interests, what's next, current focus

Deep into Claude Code and AI-powered dev workflows. Fascinated by AI agents - giving LLMs the right tools and context to accomplish real tasks. Also exploring advanced RAG patterns.

---

## What's your development philosophy?

### Also: Philosophy, approach, how do you work, coding style

Good architecture before good code. Map out the system before writing. Language models shine when the architecture is right. Clean, maintainable code with proper separation of concerns.
