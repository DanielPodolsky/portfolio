# Technical Skills

## What is your tech stack?
### Also: What technologies do you use, tech stack, what do you know, your skills, what can you build with

My core stack is MERN - MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js - combined with AWS cloud services and AI/LLM integration. I'm a full-stack developer who can build complete applications from database to UI, with a focus on integrating modern AI capabilities.

## Do you know React? What about frontend development?
### Also: React, frontend, UI, client-side, do you use React, JavaScript frameworks

Yes, React is my primary frontend framework. I work with React 19 and modern patterns including hooks, functional components, and the Context API for state management. I write all my React code in TypeScript with strict mode enabled for type safety. For styling, I use Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui components, and I build with Vite for fast development and optimized production builds. I care about performance - my portfolio achieves Lighthouse 100 scores through techniques like lazy loading and memoization.

## What backend technologies do you use?
### Also: Backend, server-side, Node, Express, API, do you know Node.js

I build backends with Node.js and Express.js. I design REST APIs with proper middleware patterns and error handling. For databases, I work with MongoDB using Mongoose for schema modeling and data validation. I also build serverless functions when the architecture calls for it - I've deployed Lambda functions on AWS for scalable backend services.

## Do you have cloud experience? AWS?
### Also: Cloud, AWS, Amazon, serverless, Lambda, deployment, infrastructure

I have hands-on AWS experience from building MentorHIT, which won second place at the AWS Public Sector Innovation Hackathon. I've worked with AWS Lambda for serverless compute, AWS Bedrock for LLM integration, and OpenSearch for vector search in RAG applications. I understand serverless architecture patterns and how to design systems that scale.

## Do you work with AI? What's your experience with LLMs?
### Also: AI, LLM, machine learning, GPT, RAG, artificial intelligence, generative AI, do you know AI

AI integration is where I really come alive. I specialize in RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation - which lets you ground language models in real data instead of letting them hallucinate. I've built three AI-powered applications: MentorHIT uses AWS Bedrock with RAG to give students personalized career guidance, my LLM-Powered Log Analyzer uses a factory pattern to abstract different LLM providers like Hugging Face and OpenAI, and this portfolio's chatbot uses GPT with Pinecone vector search. My key insight from all of this? Language models do incredible things when you architect the system correctly. Good architecture matters more than prompt tricks.

---

## What tools and DevOps do you use?
### Also: DevOps, Docker, Git, deployment, version control, containers

I use Docker for containerization and have built microservices architectures. For version control, I use Git with GitHub and follow conventional commit standards for clean, readable history. I deploy applications on Vercel for frontend projects and AWS for full-stack applications. I believe in clean git history - it shows professionalism and makes collaboration easier.

---

## What are you currently learning?
### Also: Learning, exploring, interests, what's next, current focus

Right now I'm deep into Claude Code and AI-powered development workflows. I'm fascinated by creating AI agents for specific missions - giving language models the right tools and context to accomplish real tasks. I'm also exploring advanced RAG patterns to build better AI-powered applications.

---

## What's your development philosophy?
### Also: Philosophy, approach, how do you work, coding style

Good architecture comes before good code. I map out the system before writing. Language models do incredible things when you architect the system correctly - that's my key insight from building AI applications. I focus on clean, maintainable code with proper separation of concerns.
