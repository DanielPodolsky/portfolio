# Background

## Professional Summary

## Full Stack Developer and AI Integration Specialist. I build systems that combine thoughtful architecture with the power of LLMs - not chasing trends, but creating solutions that weren't possible a few years ago. I learned that good architecture comes before good code - I map out the system before writing code.
